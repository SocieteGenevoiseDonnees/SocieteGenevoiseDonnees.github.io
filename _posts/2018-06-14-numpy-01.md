```python
import numpy as np
```

# Numpy ndarrays and regular lists


```python
a = range(5)
b = [0,1,2,3,4]
print 'a is {} and b is {}'.format(a,b)
```


```python
c = np.arange(5)
d = np.array([0,1,2,3,4])
print 'c is {} and d is {}'.format(c, d)
```


```python
print a+b
```


```python
print c+d
```

### What is broadcasting and why does it matter?

let's say that we want b to follow a, we just need to add 5 to each element of b


```python
b = [i+5 for i in b]
print 'this is a slow b', a+b
```

with numpy it's one operation


```python
d+=5
print 'this is a fast d', np.append(c,d)
```

this also works with multiplication and division


```python
c * 20
```


```python
d/-2
```

aaah what happened there? truncation?

#### dtype


```python
a = np.arange(5)
print a.dtype
```


```python
b = np.arange(5, dtype='float64')
print b.dtype
```


```python
print (a*b).dtype
```

available types are:
- bool
- inti
- int8
- int16
- int32
- int64
- uint8
- uint16
- uint32
- uint64
- float16
- float32
- float64 or float

# converting lists to arrays


```python
a = range(5)
b = np.asarray(a)
c = np.array(a)
print "a, b and c are", a, b, c
```

# Multiple dimensions


```python
d = np.array([a,b,c])
e = np.vstack([a,b,c])
f = np.hstack([a,b,c])
print "d is", d
print "e is", e
print "f is", f
```

`hstack` seen here is roughly equivalent to `np.append` seen before and also `np.concatenate` if you're more into `c` style
