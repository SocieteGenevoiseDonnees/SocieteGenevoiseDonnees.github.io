# Primes!

## Question One: 
### For all numbers under 100 what is the largest number without common factors (prime numbers)?

Hint - test for primes like:


```python
i = 4
if i%2 == 0:
    print("divisible by two")
```

    divisible by two


Hint - Loop over numbers and check if they are divisible by previous primes. If not add to a container.

## Question Two:
### a) For all common factors of non-primes under a hundred, which is the most common?

### b) For all common factors of non-primes under a hundred, which is the largest?
