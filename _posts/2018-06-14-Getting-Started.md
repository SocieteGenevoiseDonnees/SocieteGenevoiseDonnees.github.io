# Getting Started:
## a beginners tutorial on Data Analysis.


Did you ever feel left behind when your friends start talking about their awesome analysis? Are you kaggle scores embarrassingly low? Then this is the meetup for you!

This special session will focus on a beginners guide to some general tools for data analysis with python. Bring your laptop for this hands on introduction to a full analysis chain. Including some exercises on:
- git : Forking code, making alterations and initiating pull requests.
- Numpy : multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Pandas : Loading data into python and cleaning.
- matplotlib : Looking at your data
- Scikitlearn: A first look at learning from your data.

In the 'live' session we began with an introduction to `git` and `python` every developer has thier own preferences for running these. You might want to run everything in colab, or on the Google Cloud Platform. Many sites will recommend installing everything locally with anaconda. Docker is becoming an essential tool for data science. All these options are perfectly valid and are left at the discression of the user. The outline of the tutorials is as follows
