      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 text-gray ml-3">
        <li>Make sure the topic does not fall under a previous edition</li>
        <li>An introductory blog post should be listed explaining the many facets (or some of them at least) of the topic</li>
        <li>Supply a dataset and/or on notebook/code example that allows others to experience the nature of the topic for themselves</li>
        <li>The topic should be suitable for community discussion. Cutting edge ideas for pushing the boundaries of data science are just as valid as peoples desire to learn about a topic starting from scratch.</li>
